# fileexplorer

A web application to explore files on your local filesystem. My goal is to create a custom multimedia file explorer.  My first step is to add thumbnails and pop-ups for image files.  Then I plan on incorporating the same for some 3D data formats.

## TODO

* Create python package with installation instructions
