# fileexplorer

A web application to explore files on your local filesystem. My goal is to create a custom multimedia file explorer.  My first step is to add thumbnails and pop-ups for image files.  Then I plan on incorporating the same for some 3D data formats.

## Installation

In the root directory with the `pyproject.toml` file, run `python -m pip install .`

## Running

Once fileexplorer is installed, run `python -m flask --app fileexplorer run` to launch the Flask server.
